# rust-playground
learning rust along with the [rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch00-00-introduction.html)

## Tags
* To follow along, see the tags in the repo.
* `v{x}.{y}.{z}` is how the tags are stored.
* `y` is the chapter name of the the rest book.
* So `v0.2.0` means the second chapter gets finished on the tagged commit.
* `x` will be incremented after the book is finished and I start making toy projects in it.
* I am aiming to cover data structure and algorithm problems in the future.
